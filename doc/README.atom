Supported Images:

  * guacamayo-image-mediaserver,
  * guacamayo-image-audioplayer,
  * guacamayo-image-mex, with Mex under X11.

Known Issues:

  * When a NAS device with large amount of media is encountered for the first
    time, the indexing of the files by tracker-upnp results in a high CPU load,
    making the system sluggish; this can also interfer with indexing files on
    the image itself (e.g., when demos are included). A work around is to wait
    for the indexing to finish and reboot the device.
