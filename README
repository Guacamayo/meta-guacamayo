This repository contains the buildsystem for the guacamole images:

meta-gucamole: this is the guacamole layerwe will split it out

upstream: this is where the upstream meta layers go; to add a new meta layer:
           1. add git submodule into a subdir of upstream
           2. link the meta-whatever dir into the layers dir
           3. update meta-guacamole/conf/bblayers.conf.sample accordingly
           4. rm build/conf/bblayer.conf so it gets regenerated

layers:   this directory holds all the layers into a single whole

Normal workflow:

  git submodule update

  source init-build-env

  edit build/local.conf to something sensible

  bitbake guacamole-image
