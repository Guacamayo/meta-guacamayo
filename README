WHAT IS GUACAMOLE?!
-------------------
The aim of the Guacamole Project is to provide a reference software stack for
Linux-based media servers and similar devices. The Guacamole framework is based
on the Yocto platform (what else?).


HARDWARE
--------
At present images are known to work with Intel Atom based devices such as Zotac
ZBox, and the Beagleboard board. Support for Raspberry PI is planned (once we
have the HW ...).


BUILDING IT
-----------

  git clone git://github.com/Guacamole/meta-guacamole.git
  cd meta-guacamole
  git submodule update --init

  source init-build-env

  bitbake guacamole-image-headless

The images are located in the tmp/deploy/images directory; image type and
subsequent installation is, naturally, depended on the device.


TWEAKING IT
-----------
Documentation on working Poky in general can be found at yocto-project.org; the
following is specific to Guacamole:

Images
......
Although multiple image recipes can be found in the repository, for now it is
recommended to stick to guacamole-image-headless, which provides system without
a graphical environment.

Audio Codecs
............
Out of the box you get support for Ogg and Flac; Mp3 support in Guacamole images
is facilitated by the Fluendo Gstreamer plugin, but as this requires a license
for commercial use, it is disabled by default; you can enable it by whitelisting
commercial licenses in your build/conf/local.conf.


REPOSITORY LAYOUT
-----------------
The git repository contains the build system for the guacamole images, with the
following sub directories:

meta-guacamole: the guacamole layer for Poky; the aim is to keep this as thin
          as possible, using upstream Yocto packages where possible and
          appropriate.

upstream: this is where the upstream meta layers go; to add a new meta layer:
           1. add git submodule into a subdirectory of upstream
           2. link the meta-whatever directory into the layers directory
           3. update meta-guacamole/conf/bblayers.conf.sample accordingly
           4. rm build/conf/bblayer.conf so it gets regenerate in the next step
           5. sour init-build-env

layers:   this directory holds all the layers into a single whole; it should
          contain no real files, only symlinks

          NB: Only the Yocto and Guacamole are used as normal OE layers; bits
              of other layers are currently 'cherry-picked' using symlinks due
              to compatibility issues between some layers and lack of fine-honed
              control over layer priorities
