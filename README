WHAT IS GUACAMAYO?!
-------------------
The aim of the Guacamayo Project is to provide a reference software stack for
Linux-based media servers and similar devices. The Guacamayo framework is based
on the Yocto platform (what else?).


HARDWARE
--------
At present images are known to work with Intel Atom based devices such as Zotac
ZBox, and the Beagleboard board. Support for Raspberry PI is planned (once we
have the HW ...).


BUILDING IT
-----------

  git clone git://github.com/Guacamayo/meta-guacamayo.git
  cd meta-guacamayo
  git submodule update --init

  source init-build-env

  bitbake guacamayo-image-headless

The images are located in the tmp/deploy/images directory; image type and
subsequent installation is, naturally, depended on the device.


TWEAKING IT
-----------
Documentation on working Poky in general can be found at yocto-project.org; the
following is specific to Guacamayo:

Images
......
guacamayo-image-headless: a small image for an audio player; should work both on
                          atom and beagleboard; good place to start with

guacamayo-image-x11:      an image with MEX on X11; only for atom-pc machine
                          at the moment (PVR dri2 GL drivers for the
                          Beagleboard are not working at present).

guacamayo-image-egl:      an image with MEX over native EGL + evdev for input,
                          only tested on the Beagleboard at the moment. This is
                          the taste of things on a more distant horizon, but
                          presently VERY EXPERIMENTAL AND MOST LIKELY BROKEN
                          in more ways that one (though should build).

NB: The -elg and -x11 images use different Clutter packages that are not
    parallel installable. If you want to build both the -x11 and -egl image
    for the same machine target, you have to manually clean up the Clutter
    packages for the given machine first with the following command:

        bitbake -c cleansstate cogl-1.10-egl cogl-1.10-x11 \
                               clutter-1.10-egl clutter-1.10-x11 \
                               clutter-gst-1.10-egl clutter-gst-1.10-x11

    (Building different image types across different machine targets, e.g.,
    -x11 for atom-pc and -egl for beagleboard, is, of course, fine.)


Audio Codecs
............
Out of the box you get support for Ogg and Flac; Mp3 support in Guacamayo images
is facilitated by the Fluendo Gstreamer plugin, but as this requires a license
for commercial use, it is disabled by default; you can enable it by whitelisting
commercial licenses in your build/conf/local.conf.


REPOSITORY LAYOUT
-----------------
The git repository contains the build system for the guacamayo images, with the
following sub directories:

meta-guacamayo: the guacamayo layer for Poky; the aim is to keep this as thin
          as possible, using upstream Yocto packages where possible and
          appropriate.

upstream: this is where the upstream meta layers go; to add a new meta layer:
           1. add git submodule into a subdirectory of upstream
           2. link the meta-whatever directory into the layers directory
           3. update meta-guacamayo/conf/bblayers.conf.sample accordingly
           4. rm build/conf/bblayer.conf so it gets regenerate in the next step
           5. sour init-build-env

layers:   this directory holds all the layers into a single whole; it should
          contain no real files, only symlinks

          NB: Only the Yocto and Guacamayo are used as normal OE layers; bits
              of other layers are currently 'cherry-picked' using symlinks due
              to compatibility issues between some layers and lack of fine-honed
              control over layer priorities
