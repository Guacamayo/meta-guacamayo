WHAT IS GUACAMOLE?!
-------------------
The aim of the Guacamole Project is to provide a reference software stack for
Linux-based media servers. It is based on the Yocto platform (simply because
it is the best!).


HARDWARE
--------
Guacamole is not targeting any particular hardware; at present images are
known to work with Intel Atom based devices and the Beagleboard board.


REPOSITORY LAYOUT
-----------------
This repository contains the buildsystem for the guacamole images, with the
following subdirectories:

meta-gucamole: the guacamole layer for Poky; the aim is to keep this as thin
          as possible, using upstream Yocto packages where possible and
          appropriate.

upstream: this is where the upstream meta layers go; to add a new meta layer:
           1. add git submodule into a subdir of upstream
           2. link the meta-whatever dir into the layers dir
           3. update meta-guacamole/conf/bblayers.conf.sample accordingly
           4. rm build/conf/bblayer.conf so it gets regenerated

layers:   this directory holds all the layers into a single whole; it should
          contain no real files, only symlinks


To build the guacamole image

  git clone git://github.com/Guacamole/meta-guacamole.git
  cd meta-guacamole
  git submodule update --init

  # edit build/local.conf to something sensible for your setup

  source init-build-env
  bitbake guacamole-image
