Subject: [PATCH 30/45] Fix for bus width which improves SD card's peformance.

This patch fixes bus width which improves peformance for SD cards.
OMAP-MMC controller's can support maximum bus width of '8'.
when bus width is mentioned as "8" in controller data,the SD
stack will check whether bus width is "4" and if not it will
set bus width to "1" and there by degrading peformance.
