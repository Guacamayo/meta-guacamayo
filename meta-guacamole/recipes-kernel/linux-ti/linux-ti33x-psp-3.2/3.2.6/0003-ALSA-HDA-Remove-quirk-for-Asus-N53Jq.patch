Subject: [PATCH 03/87] ALSA: HDA: Remove quirk for Asus N53Jq

commit a389d67cf9849aff1722ed73186a584e2196a873 upstream.

The user reports that he needs to add model=auto for audio to
work properly. In fact, since node 0x15 is not even a pin node,
the existing fixup is definitely wrong. Relevant information can
be found in the buglink below.
