Subject: [PATCH 67/90] USB: cdc-wdm: better allocate a buffer that is at
 least as big as we tell the USB core
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 655e247daf52b202a6c2d0f8a06dd2051e756ce4 upstream.

As it turns out, there was a mismatch between the allocated inbuf size
(desc->bMaxPacketSize0, typically something like 64) and the length we
specified in the URB (desc->wMaxCommand, typically something like 2048)
